      # Project Rules


      ## Core Principles & Communication

      - **Response Length**: Maximum 4 lines of text output (excluding tool
      use/code)

      - No preambles or postambles

      - No emojis unless requested

      - Explain non-trivial bash commands before execution

      - Direct answers without elaboration

      - Follow existing project conventions rigorously

      - Never assume library/framework availability - verify through config
      files

      - Match existing code style, structure, and patterns

      - Write minimal, focused comments explaining "why" not "what"

      - Be proactive but confirm significant scope changes

      - Keep responses in monospace GitHub-flavored markdown

      - Only use tools for tasks, not communication

      - If refusing a request, keep it to 1-2 sentences with alternatives


      ## Directory Structure & File Organization

      - Keep base directory clean

      - Store progress files in logs/

      - Store temporary processing files in tmp/

      - Clear tmp/ files when no longer needed

      - No temporary files in base directory without permission


      ### File Organization

      - Configuration files in config/

      - Source code in src/

      - Documentation in docs/

      - Frontend code in frontend/

      - Archive materials in archive/

      - Logs in logs/


      ## Code Production & Testing

      ### Understanding Context

      - Analyze surrounding code/tests/config first

      - Verify established patterns through imports, package files

      - Ensure idiomatic integration

      - Use search tools extensively for codebase understanding


      ### Testing & Verification Requirements

      - **Mandatory for all code**: Unit tests, linting, type-checking (in that
      order)

      - Follow project-specific test procedures (check README/package files)

      - Test files labeled as "test_*"

      - Port tested code to production scripts

      - Remove test files after successful integration

      - **Testing completeness**: Cover main functionality and edge cases


      ### Configuration & Safety

      - No hardcoded values (URLs, secrets, IDs, etc.) in the code. Only in
      config files!

      - Store config in appropriate files (JSON, YAML, .env, etc.)

      - Apply security best practices

      - Never expose/commit sensitive data

      - Verify credentials/API keys exist before assuming unavailable


      ## Development Workflow

      ### Task Management (TodoWrite Usage)

      - **Mandatory for**: Multi-step tasks, debugging, new features

      - **Optional for**: Simple single-action requests

      - **Granularity**: Break tasks into 15-30 minute chunks

      - Mark tasks complete immediately after completion

      - Track progress visibly throughout conversation


      ### Software Engineering Tasks

      1. **Understand**: Use search tools extensively (parallel when
      independent)

      2. **Plan**: Use TodoWrite for complex tasks, share concise plan

      3. **Implement**: Follow established patterns, use absolute paths

      4. **Test**: Run tests, linting, type-checking in sequence

      5. **Verify**: Confirm all checks pass before completion


      ## Tool Usage Guidelines

      ### Parallel vs Sequential

      - **Parallel**: Independent searches, unrelated file reads, separate
      linting commands

      - **Sequential**: Dependent operations, file modifications followed by
      tests

      - **Batch rule**: Always combine independent bash commands in single
      message


      ### Error Handling Protocol

      1. Report tool failures immediately

      2. Check for missing dependencies in config files

      3. Suggest alternatives or ask for user guidance

      4. Never retry failed operations without addressing root cause


      ## Git Repository Guidelines

      ### Staging & Commits

      - **Auto-stage**: Never stage changes automatically

      - **Commit process**: 
        1. `git status && git diff HEAD && git log -n 3`
        2. Propose commit message matching recent style
        3. Only commit when explicitly requested
      - **Commit format**: Clear, concise, focus on "why" over "what"

      - Never push without explicit user request


      ### Documentation Updates

      - **Required when**: Adding new features, changing APIs, modifying
      workflows

      - **Update targets**: README, relevant .md files in docs/

      - Include labeled images from docs/ where relevant

      - Update after successful testing, before commit


      ## User Experience

      - First line in purple for script execution visibility

      - Use color syntax when possible

      - Progress indicators for operations >10 seconds

      - Activate virtual env before Python execution

      - Reference code as `file_path:line_number`


      ## Security & Safety

      - Handle security defensively only

      - No malicious code assistance

      - Explain system-modifying commands before execution

      - Remind about sandboxing for critical system operations

      - Never expose secrets in logs or commits


      ## Code References & Communication

      ```

      user: 2 + 2

      assistant: 4


      user: Where are errors handled?

      assistant: Client errors handled in `src/client.js:45`

      ```


      **Key Guidelines:**

      1. Standardized 4-line response limit

      2. Defined parallel vs sequential tool usage

      3. Specified TodoWrite mandatory/optional scenarios

      4. Clarified testing requirements hierarchy

      5. Detailed git staging/commit workflow

      6. Added error handling protocol

      7. Specified documentation update triggers

      8. Separated temporary files (tmp/) from logs (logs/)
